        <h1>Dynamic Ad-Tech Ads</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Dynamic Ad-tech template with colour themes and reporting. This is an example of the latest project I have been working on, a 300 x 250 Google ad size as the unexpanded ad.
          <br><br>
          When the user clicks on the ad, it expands to full screen to show the rest of the content.
          <br>
          In this example, there are three content themes and three to four slides in each theme.
          <br>
          Each slide can have a video or image background with a short description, this is presented with a carousel slider. When you click on any of the slides, it expands to show more content like images and video as well as other HTML elements like forms and buttons.
          <br><br>
          On the bottom of the screen it shows buttons to go to the next content theme, this can be used to support brand stories or themes.
          <br><br>
          Ensuring efficiency and rapid turnaround, I automated the theme customization process through a .json file. This enables seamless content replacement, facilitating the generation of multiple ad sizes with ease.
          <br><br>
          This also includes a tracking pixel and other trackers to build dynamic reports for AB Testing. You are then able to generate content based on user interactions.

          <li>Using Adobe Illustrator to create the card illustrations, icons, and other graphics needed for the site.</li>
          <li>Using Adobe After Effects to create the animation and export it in Lottie format. Ensure that the animation complements the overall design and adds a visually appealing element to the site.</li>
          <li>Export to Lottie: The plugin enables users to export their animations in the Lottie format, which produces small-sized JSON files that can be easily used in web and app development.</li>

        <h2>The Brief</h2>
        <p>
          I was tasked with creating a new website for Rocketfuel, from design to development and a promotional video.
          Together with the owner we came up with a modern, easy to navigate design that showcases the brand and what
          they do. Bold headers and exciting imagery came together to make a great website that I'm really proud of.
        </p>

          We decided to create an inspirational style video asking the question... What is your shape? This illustrates
          that Rocketfuel will help develop a brand shape, look and feel for a potential client. I recorded the voiceover 
          and edited it in Audition.

        </p>

        <h2>The Brief</h2>
        <p>
          I was tasked with creating a login front page and main subject category widget for students to be able to log
          in and start learning. The platform was built by Fuse to allow clients to easily customize a skin to fit any business
          by creating widgets to get functionality using API calls. They needed a modern responsive login page with a style
          that matched the social media video.

        <p>
          Magdalena needed an animated inspirational video with a very specific style, which had initially been
          developed with another designer. I was tasked with creating a video with the same abstract style to 
          follow in the series of animated videos. It consists of abstract shapes spaced out in 3D to create 
          the image. As the camera moves it creates an image on screen and then morphs into another shape.
