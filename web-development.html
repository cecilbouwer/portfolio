        <h1>Dynamic Ad-Tech Ads</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Dynamic Ad-tech template with colour themes and reporting. This is an example of the latest project I have been working on, a 300 x 250 Google ad size as the unexpanded ad.
          <br><br>
          When the user clicks on the ad, it expands to full screen to show the rest of the content.
          <br>
          In this example, there are three content themes and three to four slides in each theme.
          <br>
          Each slide can have a video or image background with a short description, this is presented with a carousel slider. When you click on any of the slides, it expands to show more content like images and video as well as other HTML elements like forms and buttons.
          <br><br>
          On the bottom of the screen it shows buttons to go to the next content theme, this can be used to support brand stories or themes.
          <br><br>
          Ensuring efficiency and rapid turnaround, I automated the theme customization process through a .json file. This enables seamless content replacement, facilitating the generation of multiple ad sizes with ease.
          <br><br>
          This also includes a tracking pixel and other trackers to build dynamic reports for AB Testing. You are then able to generate content based on user interactions.

        <h1>Fuse School</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Fuse School is a free online learning platform for the South African school curriculum covering math, science,
          biology and English.
        </p>

        <h2>The Brief</h2>
        <p>
          I was tasked with creating a login front page and main subject category widget for students to be able to log
          in and start learning. The platform was built by Fuse to allow clients to easily customize a skin to fit any business
          by creating widgets to get functionality using API calls. They needed a modern responsive login page with a style
          that matched the social media video.

          The Fuse School video was created for social media. Beautiful illustrations, animation and voiceover made the
          video great. I recorded the voiceover and edited it in Audition.

          Oh My Art is an art studio which offers classes for children and adults on an ongoing basis.
          It also has a small retail section, with products available in-store and online.
        </p>

        <h2>The Brief</h2>
        <p>
          Oh My Art was a new business when I started working with them. Therefore, I was required to create an
          apporpriate logo to be used on business cards, bags, decor, and other promotioinal items.
          Together with the owner, we decided to develop a recognisable identity for the website which would reflect the
          quirky and fun nature of the studio and the products offered.
          The website also needed to be easy to navigate in order for potential customers to find and book art classes.
