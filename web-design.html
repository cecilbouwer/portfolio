        </p>

        <h2>The Brief</h2>
        <p>
          Oh My Art was a new business when I started working with them. Therefore, I was required to create an
          apporpriate logo to be used on business cards, bags, decor, and other promotioinal items. Together with the
          owner, we decided to develop a recognisable identity for the website which would reflect the quirky and fun
          nature of the studio and the products offered. The website also needed to be easy to navigate in order for
          potential customers to find and book art classes.
